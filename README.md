Ruby methods to be used with Cucumber + Watir-Webdriver to help automation.

A set of Ruby methods that can help search for elements on a webpage.
The ruby method will take in: the watir browser, element tag name, element text/name/value (on the page) and/or the index.
It uses watir's elements.find to search for the particular tag name and return the element accordingly.

->Goal<- 
To avoid having to write an individual Cucumber Vocabulary for every specific kind of element search.
The example in the .feature file shows how one Cucumber Vocabulary can use the Ruby method to find any element.

More functionalities may be added in the future.
